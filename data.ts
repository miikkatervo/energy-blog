        This work in progress blog contains my thoughts on the global energy shift from fossil fuels to climate friendly energy sources. My thoughts are based on what I have learned from articles, talks and books. Currently I have not included sources within the text, so in the end do your own research and take the assumptions and ideas in this blog with a grain of salt. But in the end I’m really honored for you to be reading and hopefully you learn something new.

        text: `Let's get straight to the point. Humans don’t like to do hard, manual work, so we had animals, slaves and eventually machines do the work for us.

        With the creation of the steam engine, humans could grasp the power of hundreds of horses in one compact device. The steam engine utilizes flammable substances such as coal to boil water. The steam from the boiling water creates pressure inside a cylinder and moves a piston and creates kinetic energy. This technology was adapted to many fields such as transportation, and thus the industrial revolution began.

        heading: "The Greenhouse Effect",
        text: `Ever since the creation of the steam engine, humans have been burning coal and other FFs (fossil fuels) for power, and it was going relatively well. During the 1950s though, the first concerns of climate change were rising. The greenhouse effect was for a long time under debate if it was caused by humans or a natural phenomenon (the oil companies lobbying for the latter), eventually being broadly recognised as mostly being the aftermath of humans emitting GHGs (greenhouse gasses) into the atmosphere. It is natural that there is some GHG such as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, we have only skyrocketed the amount during the last century.

        GHGs are emitted into the atmosphere mainly by burning FFs such as coal, oil and natural gas. Other sources of GHG exist, such as cow farts, but we won’t be going over them here. The term greenhouse effect -spurs from the fact that like a greenhouse, the heat from the sun is trapped in the earth due to the GHG filled atmosphere. The amount of GHG in the atmosphere has risen due to the amount of modern machines burning FFs for power. The greenhouse effect has led to a steady increase in the earth's average temperature. 
        
        Ever since the effects of climate change were realized, climate activists have been pursuing the adaptation of “clean” forms of energy, which don’t emit GHG into the atmosphere.

        text: `In 2021 the EU has set climate targets to fight against climate change. The main goal is for Europe to be climate neutral by 2050. An intermittent goal is to reduce net GHG emissions by 55% compared to 1990 by 2030. To fight against climate change, we first must stop emitting GHGs into the atmosphere more than the earth can sustain. Then we must begin removing GHG particles, to once again reach more natural levels of GHG in the atmosphere.

        Thus climate neutrality is only half the battle. To actually stop the earth from warming, we must also remove excess GHG particles from the atmosphere via CCS (Carbon Capture and Storage) or other means.
        
        Currently we are not on course to achieve climate neutrality by 2050. This hard task cannot be left solely to altruism. We cannot expect all decision makers to have humanities best interests first in mind. The key is to innovate climate friendly alternatives to existing GHG emitting solutions, which are on par if not cheaper than what we currently have.

        heading: "What should we do?",
        text: `The popular theme in the field of energy production is moving from FFs to RESs (renewable energy sources). FFs are resources found deep in the earth, such as coal, oil and natural gas. By burning these substances we can make a combustion engine equipped car move, but also emit carbon dioxide into the atmosphere as a byproduct.

        The process of burning a resource to produce energy is not always seen as a harmful process. For example in some bioplants the excess bark and other material from trees which cannot be used for construction are burned and used as energy. Even though this process emits GHGs, it is seen as climate neutral, because trees also suck carbon from the air and trees renew way faster than FFs.
        
        Climate neutrality means that we stop adding GHG such as carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. This can be achieved by two ways:
        1. No more burning FFs.
        2. Burn FFs but don’t let the GHG into the atmosphere (and hopefully use it in some meaningful way).
        
        The first option is of course the better way to go about it, due to FFs being a nonrenewable resource, which we will run out of eventually. On the other hand, we won’t be powering every car or plane with electricity overnight, thus innovation in harnessing carbon dioxide right after it is formed or pulling it from the air would help during the transition period to clean energy. 
        
        But for now let’s concentrate on not burning FFs anymore. 
        
        OK, let’s say that all the countries in the world decide today that as of tomorrow, the usage of FFs and emitting GHGs is strictly banned. Hooray right? Well, as you can also figure out, no, It would be a catastrophe.

        heading: "Electrification and turbines",
        text: `To achieve climate neutrality we must switch FFs to RESs.. As the name suggests, renewables are not a finite source, thus they are mostly sustainable and above all they do not add GHG to the atmosphere. Popular RESs are solar, hydro, wind and wave power and geothermal heat. Disclaimer that currently this blog is not really covering the field of heating and cooling, but it is also important nonetheless.

        Most RESs cannot be used as a power source by themselves. Of course there are some instances, such as sailing ships moving with wind power, but the world has accustomed to the instant and reliable power that FFs can provide, thus electrification has become a crucial part of the equation.
        
        Electrification means turning machines such as cars from running on FFs to running on electricity. Electricity in itself is not something that can be mined from the earth, but it is a carrier of energy from the blow of the mind to moving a car. Electricity is mainly produced using turbines, but there exists other ways such as solar panels. In a nutshell, turbines convert kinetic energy into electricity, by a specific force rotating a coil in a magnetic field, which produces a current of electricity. 
        
        The force for the rotation can be produced in different ways. Wind turbines are powered by moving air (the sun), hydropower turbines by moving water (gravity) for example. FFs are also used to power turbines by steaming water which creates pressure and rotates the turbine. Nuclear power generates electricity in a similar fashion as FFs, but it does not emit GHGs into the atmosphere.

        text: `OK so let’s just change the FF turbines to RES turbines and turn everything electric?

        Well this is a plan, but it is not so simple. At the moment, our electrical infrastructure is based on hourly adjusting production to the usage. By usage I mean when electric powered devices are used. When the need for electricity increases, the production has to increase as well.
        
        This means we need control and reliability in our energy production. THis is what FF turbines provide, and RES turbines currently do not. As you can imagine, If the need for electricity increases, it is a lot easier to just add more fuel to the fire and steam more water than to make the wind blow harder or the sun to shine brighter. This is not the case with all RES turbines though, since the output from hydropower turbines and nuclear power is manageable to increase and decrease to a certain extent. A solution of switching energy production solely to these sources is not possible since there are not enough hydro and nuclear resources on earth.
        
        Innovation is needed to solve the problem of reliability in using wind and solar power. An option would be to store power when production is higher than usage, then use the stored power when the production is less.
        
        Storing RES energy is not yet truly scalable though. When it comes to storing electricity you might think of using batteries, but they are still not scalable outside of powering our car, but making huge batteries is still under development but as of now still too expensive.
        
        One thing to mention is that energy doesn’t have to be morphed into electricity. A hot topic at the moment is hydrogen fuel. Green hydrogen fuel can be produced via electrolysis with electricity from RES turbines. The fuel can later be morphed again into electricity or used as an energy source by itself. A problem with hydrogen fuel is that converting electricity into hydrogen is not yet effective enough, but research is being done as we speak.
        
        To switch from FF turbines to RES, we need to increase RES production. As we speak, more RES turbines and solar panels are being constructed, and a new nuclear reactor is being tested in Olkiluoto.
        
        Constructing new turbines and plants is not as simple as you would think. There is a ton of regulation and restrictions on where you can build and how much. Because RES utilizes the natural resources of the earth, it also affects the natural wildlife. Countries such as Germany have even banned the production of nuclear power, due to health and security reasons.
        
        Wind turbines are still seen by many as unattractive and loud, so they have to be constructed away from civilization and in areas where the wind constantly blows, usually in the coasts. The amount of useful land is limited, so new off-shore wind turbines have been in development. By constructing the wind turbines off-shore, we can have more and larger turbines, which can be grouped up in farms. The trade-off is that the costs for construction and maintenance are higher compared to on-shore. Still the amount of off-shore wind turbines has highly increased during the last years, and coastal countries such as Denmark and Great Britain are investing heavily on it to solve their energy needs. Tide and wave energy is also being currently researched but still at a relatively young stage.
        
        When you try to research RES opportunities, it gets confusing pretty quickly. Things are never as simple as it seems. Even though RES production doesn’t emit GHG, it does so indirectly. The amount of GHG emitted is usually pretty high during construction and maintenance of new turbines and facilities, and during the manufacturing of the parts for the new installation. As said before, RES also affects the natural wildlife and usually requires a lot of space, which might end up destroying some plants and animal’s homes. It’s great that an electric car doesn’t emit GHG while driving, but the amount of GHG emitted during the manufacturing of the car and battery are usually really high. 
        
        Change is also not cheap. This is why we need regulations which economically favor the deployment and research of RES energy solutions. 
        
        Sometimes it might seem that whatever we do, it always has some downside. This is true to almost anything. And it is great that ideas and decisions are challenged, this way we can learn and be better. But in the end, change HAS to come.
